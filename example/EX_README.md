## Human Algorithm

### Pseudo-Code
```text
Write your human decision rules here.
```

When examining the data and visualizations, we focused on the features ___ and ___ because ___.

The plots/tables suggested a possible threshold for ___, and we considered values above or below this point to see how they might relate to ___.

From the summary tables and visualizations, it appeared that ___ could influence classification, which led us to ___ in our decision rules.

### Confusion Matrix

Accuracy: ?

| Actual \ Predicted | Class 1 | Class 2 | Class 3 |
|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Class 1**       |         |         |         |
| **Class 2**       |         |         |         |
| **Class 3**       |         |         |         |

One example where our algorithm worked well is when the inputs were ___, leading to a correct prediction of ___ because ___.

An example where the algorithm did not perform as expected is when the inputs were ___, resulting in a prediction of ___ instead of ___, which may have happened because ___.

These examples of success and failure highlight patterns in the data or limitations in our rules, such as ___.

## Machine Learning Model

We chose a value of k = ___ after comparing model performance across different values of k and observing that ___.

When analyzing the outputs and metrics, we noticed that changing k affected ___, which influenced our final choice.

Based on the results shown in the tables or visualizations, k = ___ best matched our goals for model performance because ___.

### Confusion Matrix

Accuracy: ?

| Actual \ Predicted | Class 1 | Class 2 | Class 3 |
|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Class 1**       |         |         |         |
| **Class 2**       |         |         |         |
| **Class 3**       |         |         |         |

The table/visualization shows a clear pattern where the model predicts ___ when ___, indicating a strong relationship between these features.

The confusion matrix reveals that the model most often confuses ___ with ___, suggesting these classes have similar feature values.

Compared to the human algorithm, the KNN model shows different behavior when ___, as seen in the ___ visualization.
